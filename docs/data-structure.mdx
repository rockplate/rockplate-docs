# Data Structure

## Table of Contents

## Primitives

Primitives are identified with `Object` and `Property`

You should create an object identified by a string key

E.g: Order object identified by `"order"`

```json
{
  "order": {
    "paid": true,
    "total": "$450.00"
  }
}
```

```rockplate
Total: [order total]

[if order is paid]
  Paid
[end if]
```

Two types of primitive types are supported: `Booleans` and `Identifiers`

### Booleans

Booleans are equivalant to JavaScript/JSON boolean values. Only accepted values are `true` and `false`

E.g: Order object with `"paid"` boolean property

```json
{
  "order": {
    "paid": true
  }
}
```

```rockplate
[if order is paid]
  Paid
[end if]
```

### Identifiers

Primitive variables other than booleans are called identifiers. Commonly these are strings, but can be any JavaScript/JSON primitive values including numbers.

E.g: Order object with `"total"` identifier property

```json
{
  "order": {
    "total": "$450.00"
  }
}
```

```rockplate
Total: [order total]
```

## Arrays

Arrays are collections of `Identifiers` or `Booleans`

You should create an array identified by a string key

E.g: Orders array identified by `"orders"`

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "order": {
        "paid": true,
        "total": "$450.00"
      }
    },
    {
      "order": {
        "paid": false,
        "total": "$280.00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```rockplate
[repeat orders]
  Total: [order total]

  [if order is paid]
    Paid
  [end if]
[end repeat]
```
